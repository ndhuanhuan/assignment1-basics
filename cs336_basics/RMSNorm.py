        # When you multiply self.weight * x, PyTorch broadcasts self.weight across all leading dimensions of x.

        # the result is also (batch_size, seq_len, d_model), where each feature in the last dimension is scaled by its corresponding weight.
        #
        # Example:
        # If self.weight = tensor([1.0, 0.5, 2.0, 1.5]) and
        # x = tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]), then:

        # [
        #   [1.0*1.0, 0.5*2.0, 2.0*3.0, 1.5*4.0],   # [1.0, 1.0, 6.0, 6.0]

        # If x is (batch_size, seq_len, d_model), for every position in batch and sequence,
